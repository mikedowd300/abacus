This project creates a virtual abacus with two modes. In "demo mode" there are tutorials for its use in addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

In "challenge mode" there are levels of difficulty for addtion, addition with subtraction, multiplication and division. The initial problems will be simple, but as the user solves each problem the subsequent ones become incrementally harder.

As of 9/5/2016 the abacus does not have a functional demo mode and the challenge mode only consists of addition, but testing on it has gove well and the other challenges can be added with minimal programming.

The demo modes, as imagined by this developer, will not be videos, but rather a series of $jQuery timeouts that highlight parts of the abacus while text in a modal div explains step by step what is going on.
